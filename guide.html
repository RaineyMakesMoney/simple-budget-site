    <h2>How to Budget Your Money</h2>
    <p>Creating a budget doesn’t need to be complicated. The goal is simple: know where your money goes so you can make smarter decisions. Let’s walk through the process step by step.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>1. Know Your Income</h3>
      <p>Write down your total take-home pay — what actually hits your bank account after taxes. Include any side income, tips, or freelance earnings. If your income changes monthly, use an average from the past few months.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>2. Track Your Spending</h3>
      <p>Before you make a budget, you need to see where your money goes now. Look at your last 2–3 months of bank and credit card statements. Categorize expenses into essentials (rent, utilities, groceries) and non-essentials (subscriptions, dining out, shopping).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3. Set Realistic Spending Limits</h3>
      <p>Once you see your spending patterns, assign limits to each category. Don’t aim for perfection — aim for progress. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Housing: 30% of income</li>
        <li>Food & Groceries: 15%</li>
        <li>Transportation: 10%</li>
        <li>Savings & Debt Repayment: 20%</li>
        <li>Everything Else: 25%</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4. Use a Simple System</h3>
      <p>Pick a budgeting method that fits your lifestyle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>50/30/20 Rule</strong> – 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-based Budget</strong> – assign every dollar a job.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Envelope System</strong> – use physical envelopes to control spending.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>5. Review & Adjust Monthly</h3>
      <p>No budget is perfect on the first try. Review your spending each month and adjust as needed. The goal is steady improvement — not restriction.</p>
